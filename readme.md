## Project Title:
**Social Media Rewards Platform**

## Project Description:
The **Social Media Rewards Platform** is a decentralized application (DApp) built on Ethereum or other EVM-compatible blockchains, designed to reward users with ERC20 tokens for completing educational courses and engaging in social media tasks. Users can earn tokens for completing lessons within a course, as well as by completing tasks like sharing course content on social media platforms.

Course creators (admins) have the ability to create and manage courses, define lesson rewards, and oversee the user engagement. The platform incentivizes both education and social media promotion, allowing users to earn rewards for learning and helping spread the word about the platform.

This contract uses a reward token, which is an ERC20 token, to distribute incentives to users. It ensures that all course, lesson, and reward information is transparent and secure on the blockchain.

## Project Vision:
The vision of the **Social Media Rewards Platform** is to gamify and decentralize education, combining both learning and social media engagement. By rewarding users with ERC20 tokens for completing educational courses and fulfilling social media tasks, we aim to encourage continuous learning while increasing the platform's visibility through user-generated content on social media.

We believe that by integrating blockchain-based rewards and social media tasks, we can build a community-driven ecosystem that motivates users to engage more actively with educational content and encourages social sharing for greater educational impact.

## Key Features:

1. **Course and Lesson Management**:
   - Admins can create and manage courses with multiple lessons.
   - Each lesson has a fixed reward amount that users earn upon completion.
   - Admins have control over the activation/deactivation of courses.

2. **Incentivized Learning**:
   - Users can enroll in courses and earn ERC20 tokens for completing lessons.
   - Each completed lesson triggers a reward transfer to the user's account.

3. **Social Media Task Completion**:
   - Users earn rewards by completing social media tasks related to the courses (e.g., sharing a course on social media platforms like Twitter).
   - Social media tasks encourage users to promote the courses and expand the platform’s reach.

4. **Reward Distribution**:
   - Users earn ERC20 tokens as rewards for completing lessons and social media tasks.
   - The platform ensures transparency and security in the distribution of rewards.

5. **Reward Withdrawals**:
   - Users can withdraw their accumulated tokens at any time, as long as they meet the required balance.
   - The system allows secure ERC20 token transfers to users’ wallets.

6. **Decentralized Platform**:
   - The contract operates on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain, ensuring that data (courses, lessons, rewards) is stored transparently and immutably.

7. **Admin Controls**:
   - Admins can create, modify, and deactivate courses and lessons.
   - Admins can change the reward token contract address to accommodate different tokens.

8. **Simple and Transparent**:
   - All actions (course creation, lesson completion, reward withdrawal) are tracked on the blockchain.
   - Users can easily track their progress and rewards in real-time.

## Future Enhancements:
- **Leaderboard System**: Add a leaderboard to show top users who have earned the most rewards or completed the most lessons.
- **Additional Social Media Platforms**: Integrate more platforms for completing tasks, such as Instagram, Facebook, or YouTube.
- **NFT Rewards**: Implement NFTs as unique badges or certificates for users who complete certain milestones (e.g., finishing a course).
- **User-Created Courses**: Allow users to create their own courses, and earn a share of the rewards when others enroll in their courses.
- **Community Engagement**: Implement features like course reviews and community voting on future courses or lessons.
